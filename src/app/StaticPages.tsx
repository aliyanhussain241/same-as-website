We combine artificial intelligence with expert resume writing knowledge to help every job seeker — from fresh graduates to senior executives — write a professional, ATS-optimized resume that gets interviews. Since launching, we have helped over 500,000 job seekers in 120+ countries build better resumes and land jobs at companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and thousands of small businesses worldwide.

              The resume writing industry is broken. Career coaches charge $200 to $500 to write a single resume. Resume writing services take days to deliver. Most job seekers cannot afford either — and they end up submitting weak resumes that never get seen.
            </p>
            <p>
              We built Rezumi to change that. Our AI resume builder gives every job seeker access to the same quality of resume writing that top executives pay hundreds of dollars for — in 2 minutes, for free. Whether you are writing your first resume with no experience, switching careers after 10 years, or applying for a senior leadership role, Rezumi tailors your resume to the exact job description and ensures it passes every major ATS system.
            </p>

              We believe that your resume should never be the reason you do not get the job. That is what drives everything we build.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-8">The Story Behind Rezumi — Why We Built This</h2>
        <div className="bg-white p-8 md:p-12 rounded-3xl border border-gray-100 shadow-sm space-y-6 text-gray-600 text-lg mb-24">
          <p>Rezumi started with a frustration that millions of job seekers share.</p>
          <p>Our founder spent months applying for jobs after university, sending hundreds of carefully written resumes into what felt like a black hole. No callbacks. No interviews. Just silence. After finally getting help from a career coach — and paying $350 for a single resume rewrite — the callbacks started coming immediately. The resume content had not changed dramatically. The format had changed. The keywords had changed. The ATS compliance had changed.</p>
          <p>That experience raised a simple but powerful question: why should getting your resume right cost $350? Why is this knowledge locked behind expensive career coaches and resume writing services that most people cannot afford?</p>
          <p>We spent two years building an AI system that understands resume writing the way an expert career coach does — analyzing job descriptions, identifying the right keywords, structuring achievements for maximum impact, and formatting everything to pass ATS screening automatically.</p>
          <p>Today, Rezumi is used by job seekers in 120+ countries — from fresh graduates applying for their first internship to senior executives targeting C-suite positions. Every resume we help create reflects our core belief: the right resume should not be a privilege. It should be a right.</p>
